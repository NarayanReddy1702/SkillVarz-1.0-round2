            For the self-initiated project for the fictional tattoo artist Nicki
            Wonderkin, I created a bold and immersive website that reflects her
            edgy yet elegant artistry and creative vision. The goal was to
            establish a strong digital presence that not only showcases Nicki's
            work but also encapsulates her unique personality and style. The
            design emphasizes a striking visual identity, blending dark,
            dramatic tones with vibrant highlights that echo the energy and
            precision of her tattoo designs.

          <p class=" text-xl font-[font-4] text-gray-700">
            The site was used to explore several UX-related elements such as the
            gallery including an elegant filter system as well as a smooth and
            high-end lightbox implementation to showcase the works. Furthermore
            a large emphasis was placed on blending the storytelling aspect of a
            portfolio with the seamless accessibility and smooth funneling of a
            conversion-centered business.
